# MentalBERT_BiLSTM_CNN_(Re_Revised).ipynb Analysis

## Overview

The `MentalBERT_BiLSTM_CNN_(Re_Revised).ipynb` notebook is a comprehensive machine learning implementation for mental health text classification. This notebook represents an advanced hybrid approach that combines three powerful neural network architectures to classify mental health-related text statements.

## Purpose

This notebook is designed to:
- Classify mental health-related text statements into different categories
- Leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques
- Provide accurate mental health condition detection from textual data
- Serve as a research tool for mental health classification tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Model Components

The notebook implements a sophisticated hybrid architecture combining:

1. **MentalBERT**: A specialized BERT model pre-trained on mental health-related text
   - Provides contextual understanding of mental health terminology
   - Generates rich semantic embeddings for input text

2. **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**: 
   - Captures sequential patterns in both forward and backward directions
   - Maintains long-term dependencies in text sequences
   - Enhances temporal understanding of text context

3. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**:
   - Extracts local features and patterns from text
   - Identifies important n-gram patterns
   - Provides spatial feature extraction capabilities

### Technical Stack

- **TensorFlow**: 2.15.0 (Primary deep learning framework)
- **Transformers**: For MentalBERT model integration
- **Keras**: Neural network API (with legacy mode enabled)
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities and evaluation metrics
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
